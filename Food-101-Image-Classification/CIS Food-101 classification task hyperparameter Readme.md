# Image Classification with EfficientNet and Optuna Hyperparameter Tuning


## Overview

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for image classification using EfficientNet, with hyperparameter tuning performed using Optuna. We also integrate Weights & Biases (W&B) for logging and tracking experiment results.

## Features

  EfficientNet Model: A state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for image classification.

  Optuna for Hyperparameter Tuning: Automated hyperparameter optimization to find the best configuration.

  W&B Integration: Logging training metrics and visualization for better analysis.

  Data Augmentation: Using techniques to improve model generalization.

  Training Pipeline: Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

  Performance Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
```
pip install torch torchvision timm optuna wandb matplotlib numpy
```

How to Use

- Setup W&B

  * Create an account at Weights & Biases and login using wandb.login().

- Load Dataset

  * Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (e.g., structured in train/test folders or available as a PyTorch dataset).

- Run Hyperparameter Tuning

  * Execute the notebook to start Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning.

- Train the Best Model

  * Once the best hyperparameters are selected, train the model using them.

- Evaluate the Model

  *Check metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

- Monitor Experiments

  * Track training progress on W&B dashboards.
