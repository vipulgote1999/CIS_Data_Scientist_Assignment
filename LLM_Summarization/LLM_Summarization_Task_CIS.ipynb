            " gadolinium - enhanced t1-weighted images help to characterize the internal architecture of cystic lesions and improve the detection of solid components.2425 mr imaging has been shown to be superior to doppler ultrasound and conventional ct in the diagnosis of malignant ovarian masses [ the estimated area under receiver operating characteristic curve ( auc ) was 0.78 for ultrasound , 0.87 for ct , and 0.91 for mr imaging].26 although ct has not traditionally been used in the characterization of an adnexal mass , studies have shown that the utility of thin - section multislice ct is equivalent to that of ultrasound . \n",

            " ancillary findings , such as ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis on ultrasound , ct , or mr imaging are strong indicators of a malignant etiology for an adnexal mass . several cases of families with both males and females diagnosed with germ cell cancers have been documented . \n",
            " the low incidence of ovarian germ cell cancers suggests that multiple occurrences in the same family may not be due to chance . \n",
            " rather , it is possible that a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian germ cell cancers , and possibly to germ cell tumors in males as well , is present in at least some of these families.27 the primary goal of radiologic assessment is the differentiation of malignant tumors from benign tumors , rather than determination of histologic subtype . sometimes , it is possible , however , to suggest the histologic subtype of an epithelial neoplasm based on particular imaging features . \n",

            " the optimal use of ultrasound requires the analysis of morphologic features and doppler findings.1114 ovarian masses with septations greater than 3 mm , mural nodularity , and papillary projections suggest the diagnosis of malignant ovarian neoplasm.1517 the most significant feature is the presence of solid components within an ovarian mass,18 other features suggesting malignant etiology include vascular septations thicker than 3 mm , septal nodularity , and single or multiple enhancing solid components within a cystic mass.1920 necrosis within a solid lesion is also a strong indicator of malignancy . in our cases , \n",
            " many of these features such as solid components , central necrosis , heterogeneity , free fluid and central increased vscularity were present . \n",
            " central color doppler flow within solid components of an ovarian mass has been shown to be an accurate predictor of malignancy.182122 brown and colleagues18 studied 211 adnexal masses , including 28 malignancies to determine the best discrimination between benignity and malignancy by gray - scale and doppler . a nonhyperechoic solid component within a mass , central blood flow on color doppler imaging , free intraperitoneal fluid , and septations within a mass had 93% sensitivity and 93% specificity for diagnosis of malignancy . in a setting of \n",
            " sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses , mr imaging is used as a problem - solving tool . \n",
            " the main advantage of mr imaging is that it can provide tissue characterization based on signal properties.23 for adequate evaluation of adnexal masses on mr imaging , t1-weighted and t2- weighted images are fundamental in the delineation of pelvic anatomy and tumor . \n",
            " gadolinium - enhanced t1-weighted images help to characterize the internal architecture of cystic lesions and improve the detection of solid components.2425 mr imaging has been shown to be superior to doppler ultrasound and conventional ct in the diagnosis of malignant ovarian masses [ the estimated area under receiver operating characteristic curve ( auc ) was 0.78 for ultrasound , 0.87 for ct , and 0.91 for mr imaging].26 although ct has not traditionally been used in the characterization of an adnexal mass , studies have shown that the utility of thin - section multislice ct is equivalent to that of ultrasound . \n",
            " ct characterization of adnexal mass relies on the depiction of morphologic features of enhancing mural nodularity or heterogeneity and necrosis within a solid lesion . \n",
            " ancillary findings , such as ascites and peritoneal carcinomatosis on ultrasound , ct , or mr imaging are strong indicators of a malignant etiology for an adnexal mass . several cases of families with both males and females diagnosed with germ cell cancers have been documented . \n",
            " the low incidence of ovarian germ cell cancers suggests that multiple occurrences in the same family may not be due to chance . \n",
            " rather , it is possible that a gene that confers susceptibility to ovarian germ cell cancers , and possibly to germ cell tumors in males as well , is present in at least some of these families.27 the primary goal of radiologic assessment is the differentiation of malignant tumors from benign tumors , rather than determination of histologic subtype . sometimes , it is possible , however , to suggest the histologic subtype of an epithelial neoplasm based on particular imaging features . \n",
            " i would like , in conclusion , to recommend an early diagnosis . with the availability of recent imaging techniques , \n",
            " a full radiological investigation could be done to search for metastasis , evaluate the adjacent organs , and give an early referral to the oncology center since the tumor is chemo - sensitive .\n",

            " looking forward , the national cancer institute estimates that cancerspecific care costs will grow more quickly than overall medical expenditures 7.within surgical oncology , however , there is little consensus on whether the addition of processes of care raise expenditures ( via increased resource utilization ) or lower costs ( via increased efficiency and lower postoperative length of stay ) . and while previous literature has found that surgical complications raise costs for cancer surgery 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , much less is known about which services to remediate complications are the most costly 9 , 12 , 13 . delivering costeffective cancer surgery \n",
